For the NDPBRN project we have created a specific onotology (NDPBRN.owl) that is tailored to the project. The file is meant to provide a list of the difference between NDPBRN.owl and OHD.owl.

- The OHD has a number of anatomy classes (e.g., jaw, neck, tongue) that aren't germane to the NDPBRN project. Thus, we are using only a subset of anatomy classes.
  The import of these classes is found in NDPBRN-anatomy-classes.owl. It contains mostly classes for teeth, tooth surfaces, tooth roots, and the dentition.

- Added the 'has role' relation to hold between a patient and a gender role. OHD used 'is bearer of'.

- Removed duplication of labels in the independent continuant and material entity classes.

- Removed the "owl:Class" class.

- Removed the axioms that related hard/soft tissues exams to anatomical parts.

- Made 'member of' relation transitive. -> Changed back on non-transitive on 12/22/2016

- Added data properties:
	* has patient activity status: takes values "active"/"inactive"; used to indicate if the patient is active in the practice; there is a Y/N field in the patient table that shows this
	* first dental visit date: the date of patient's first dental visit
	* last dental visit date: the last date on which a patient had a dental visit

- Added classes: 
  * dental facility: a physical building in which dentistry is practiced; we probably won't use this
  * health care organization employee role: used for employees of the practice; probably won't need this
  * health care office staff role: might need this for records that provider ids for office personell

- Removed assertion that 'surface of tooth' was a subclass of enamel. As per FMA, this is a immaterial anatomical entity, not enamel. This needs to be fixed in OHD proper. 

- Added FMA classes for immaterial anatomical entity, anatomical boundary entity, anatomical surface, surface of organ. 

- Add classes for restored tooth finding, restored tooth surface finding, dental procedure finding.

- Add classes for each type of restored tooth surface (e.g., restored occlusal surface).

- Removed axiom for tooth restoration procedure that has specified output some "has_part some  (Tooth and ('has role' some 'tooth to be restored role'))". My reasons for doing this are 1) the 'has role' axiom looks wrong. The restoration process realizes the role, but it sounds odd for the process to output the role; 2) since the tooth restoration process outputs a restored tooth, a restored tooth by definition/axiom has part some (tooth and dental restoration material).

- Updated definition for restored tooth.

- Added classes for pulpal debridement procedure, hemisection procedure, endodontic treatment procedure, surgically modified tooth, and extracted tooth.

- Removed redundant axioms for subclasses of tooth restoration procedure.

- Added axiom "realizes some 'tooth surface to be restored role'" to intracoronal restoration procedure.

- Added axiom "realizes some 'dental patient role'" to dental procedure.

- Added axiom "has_specified_output some 'extracted tooth'" to tooth extraction procedure.

- Make endodontic procedure a defined class.

- Put BFO relations and classes in stand alone NDPBRN-bfo-relations and NDPBRN-bfo-relations files.

- Make has function/role/quality sub properties of is bearer of, and add inverses of the properties.

- Remove unused relations: has granular part, has granular process part, is granular part of, is granular part of process, is fiat part of, is aggregate of

- Remove unused relations: begins to exist during, ceases to exist during, has course, has participant beginning to exist, has participant ceasing to exist, is course of

- Remove unused relations: has site of, occurs in

- Remove RO relations has_part, 

- Add data property missing tooth number

- Change missing tooth 14 finding axiom "has_part value 14" to "'has part' value 14"

- Remove axiom "has_part some 'CRID symbol'" from CRID class in iao-imports.

- Remove has_part relation from iao-imports.

- Change "has_part some occurrent" to "'has part' some occurrent" in *disjoint with* assertion for continuant class.

- Add property chain "has_specified_input o 'is part of'" to has participant.

- Add property chain "'has part' o is_specified_input_of" to participates_in.

- Make 'restored tooth' a defined class: Tooth that 'has part' some 'dental restoration material'; and update definition

- Add axiom that a 'restored tooth surface' 'is part of' some 'restored tooth'

- Make 'extracted tooth' a defined class: Tooth that is_specified_output_of some 'tooth extraction procedure'; and update definition

- Make 'surgically modified tooth' a defined class: Tooth that (is_specified_output_of some 'surgical dental procedure'); and update definition

- Update NDPBRN-anatomy-classes.owl - Add Facial surface enamel of tooth as defined class: equivalent to Tooth and Labial surface enamel of tooth

- Add class for 'restored facial surface'

- Add axiom "has_specified_output some 'restored tooth surface'" to onlay restoration procedure

- After creating the merged/inferred ontology (NDPBRN.owl) be sure to remove the inverseOf(...) property axioms and the Asymmetric & Irreflexive property assertions. These get added in (for some reason) and cause reasoning errors. Also, remove Functional and Inverse functional property assertions from is immediately preceded by and immediately precedes. This doesn't seem correct: many events can immediately precede another event; depends how you define things I guess.

 - Added restored tooth subclasses: endodontically restored tooth, coronally restored tooth, extracoronally restored tooth, intracoronally restored tooth, and veneer surface restored tooth. these are defined classed. Their purpose is to allow the reasoner to classify certain kinds of restored teeth into convient groupings.


- Add class  endodontic restorative procedure.

- Add apicoectomy procedure and include it as type of endodontic restorative procedure.

- Make endodontic treatment procedure a subclass of  endodontic restorative procedure and add alternative term 'root canal treatment procedure' to  endodontic treatement procedure.

- Change label for 'endodontically treated tooth' to 'endodontically restored tooth' and modify defintion.

- Add class 'surgical endodontic procedure'. Make 'pulpal debridement procedure' and 'hemisection procedure' a subclass of it.

- Make 'Anterior Tooth' and 'Posterior Tooth' lower case -> 'anterior tooth', 'posterior tooth'

- Add posterior teet resin restorations: billing code D2385: resin one surface, posterior permanent, billing code D2386: resin two surface, posterior permanent, billing code D2387: resin-based composite - three surfaces, posterior, billing code D2388: resin-based composite - four or more surfaces, posterior.
