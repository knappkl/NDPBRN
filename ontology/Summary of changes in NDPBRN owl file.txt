For the NDPBRN project we have created a specific onotology (NDPBRN.owl) that is tailored to the project. The file is meant to provide a list of the difference between NDPBRN.owl and OHD.owl.

- The OHD has a number of anatomy classes (e.g., jaw, neck, tongue) that aren't germane to the NDPBRN project. Thus, we are using only a subset of anatomy classes.
  The import of these classes is found in NDPBRN-anatomy-classes.owl. It contains mostly classes for teeth, tooth surfaces, tooth roots, and the dentition.

- Added the 'has role' relation to hold between a patient and a gender role. OHD used 'is bearer of'.

- Removed duplication of labels in the independent continuant and material entity classes.

- Removed the "owl:Class" class.

- Removed the axioms that related hard/soft tissues exams to anatomical parts.

- Made 'member of' relation transitive.

- Added data properties:
	* has patient activity status: takes values "active"/"inactive"; used to indicate if the patient is active in the practice; there is a Y/N field in the patient table that shows this
	* first dental visit date: the date of patient's first dental visit
	* last dental visit date: the last date on which a patient had a dental visit

- Added classes: 
  * dental facility: a physical building in which dentistry is practiced; we probably won't use this
  * health care organization employee role: used for employees of the practice; probably won't need this
  * health care office staff role: might need this for records that provider ids for office personell
