For the NDPBRN project we have created a specific onotology (NDPBRN.owl) that is tailored to the project. The file is meant to provide a list of the difference between NDPBRN.owl and OHD.owl.

- The OHD has a number of anatomy classes (e.g., jaw, neck, tongue) that aren't germane to the NDPBRN project. Thus, we are using only a subset of anatomy classes.
  The import of these classes is found in NDPBRN-anatomy-classes.owl. It contains mostly classes for teeth, tooth surfaces, tooth roots, and the dentition.

- Added the 'has role' relation to hold between a patient and a gender role. OHD used 'is bearer of'.

- Removed duplication of labels in the independent continuant and material entity classes.

- Removed the "owl:Class" class.

- Removed the axioms that related hard/soft tissues exams to anatomical parts.

- Made 'member of' relation transitive. -> Changed back on non-transitive on 12/22/2016

- Added data properties:
	* has patient activity status: takes values "active"/"inactive"; used to indicate if the patient is active in the practice; there is a Y/N field in the patient table that shows this
	* first dental visit date: the date of patient's first dental visit
	* last dental visit date: the last date on which a patient had a dental visit

- Added classes: 
  * dental facility: a physical building in which dentistry is practiced; we probably won't use this
  * health care organization employee role: used for employees of the practice; probably won't need this
  * health care office staff role: might need this for records that provider ids for office personell

- Removed assertion that 'surface of tooth' was a subclass of enamel. As per FMA, this is a immaterial anatomical entity, not enamel. This needs to be fixed in OHD proper. 

- Added FMA classes for immaterial anatomical entity, anatomical boundary entity, anatomical surface, surface of organ. 

- Add classes for restored tooth finding, restored tooth surface finding, dental procedure finding.

- Add classes for each type of restored tooth surface (e.g., restored occlusal surface).

- Removed axiom for tooth restoration procedure that has specified output some "has_part some  (Tooth and ('has role' some 'tooth to be restored role'))". My reasons for doing this are 1) the 'has role' axiom looks wrong. The restoration process realizes the role, but it sounds odd for the process to output the role; 2) since the tooth restoration process outputs a restored tooth, a restored tooth by definition/axiom has part some (tooth and dental restoration material).

- Updated definition for restored tooth.

- Added classes for pulpal debridement procedure, hemisection procedure, endodontic treatment procedure, surgically modified tooth, and extracted tooth.

- Removed redundant axioms for subclasses of tooth restoration procedure.

- Added axiom "realizes some 'tooth surface to be restored role'" to intracoronal restoration procedure.

- Added axiom "realizes some 'dental patient role'" to dental procedure.

- Added axiom "has_specified_output some 'extracted tooth'" to tooth extraction procedure.

- Make endodontic procedure a defined class.
