For the NDPBRN project we have created a specific onotology (NDPBRN.owl) that is tailored to the project. The file is meant to provide a list of the difference between NDPBRN.owl and OHD.owl.

- The OHD has a number of anatomy classes (e.g., jaw, neck, tongue) that aren't gemain to the NDPBRN poject. Thus, we are using only a subset of antomy classes.
  The import of these classes is found in NDPBRN-anatomy-classes.owl. It contains mostly classes for teeth, tooth surfaces, tooth roots, and the dentition.

- Added the 'has role' relation to hold between a patient and a gender role. OHD used 'is bearer of'.

- Removed duplication of labels in the independent continuant and material entity classes.

- Removed the "owl:Class" class.

- Removed the axioms that related hard/soft tissues exams to anatomical parts.

- Made 'member of' relation transitive.
